This is a small experiment with the socked.io library.

To see this in action localy:
- run "npm install"
- run "node server.js" to start the server
- first open up http://localhost:3000 with a browser
- second open up http://localhost:3000 with another browser and use the devtools to replicate a mobile device.
- when you click an icon and color, the first page interact in realtime to the imputs of the mobile device.
